## TravelTales Backend------------------------------------------------
A secure RESTful API for the TravelTales blogging platform. Users can register, log in, create blog posts about countries theyâ€™ve visited, and interact with other users through likes, comments, and follows. The system is built with Node.js, Express, and SQLite, and implements strong security features including JWT authentication and CSRF protection.

## Security Highlights
- JWT in HttpOnly cookies for secure session management.
- Double Submit Cookie CSRF protection with custom middleware.
- Authorization middleware to restrict and validate access.
- All sensitive endpoints are protected using `authMiddleware` and `csrfMiddleware`.

## Usage Notes
After login, the backend sets JWT and CSRF cookies.
Include withCredentials: true and x-csrf-token header in all protected frontend requests

## Tech Stack
Node.js + Express.js
SQLite3 (lightweight relational database)
JWT + bcrypt
cookie-parser, cors
Custom middleware for auth + CSRF
